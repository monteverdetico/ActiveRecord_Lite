Built a lite version of ActiveRecord using a skeleton repo and some tutorial guidance. Created a SQLObject class with #create, #update, ::find, and ::all methods. A particular challenge in this project was writing the Associatable module with belongs_to, has_many, and has_many_through class methods.
